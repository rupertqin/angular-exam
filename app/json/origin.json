People learnedto cook and eat almost everything. They had to think of ways to make specialdishes. One of these dishes is kao zha. It‘s made withleftovers like meat，soup，oil and fat.That might not sound very good，but it does taste good.Today，kao zha is a special dish at big banquets （宴会）。<br/>Another famous dish is called zao bing. It‘s made with fruit，meat andother things. I really liked it！But I didn’t want to eattoo much. It has a lot of fat in it.<br/>I smelled something burning and I saw smoke，so I found another special food of the Ilan area─duck meat. The duck meat is put in a big oven （炉子） to cook it. Smoke keeps the meat fresh. I don’tusually eat meat，but this duck meat was delicious！It tasted sweet.<br/>Ilan is a great place with delicious food.I hope I can come back again！",
